The new version of PetroVR - PetroVR 2024 (v18.017 64-bit) - was successfully installed in the test environment.&#10;
&#10;
Models using older versions of PetroVR will be upgraded to 2024 version automatically when opened using the new version.&#10;
&#10;
Be careful as once opened in the latest version a project can not be used in an older version anymore (consider copying a project before opening in this new version).
&#10;
Release notes for the update can be found on the PetroVR CoP.
&#10;

best regards &#10;
