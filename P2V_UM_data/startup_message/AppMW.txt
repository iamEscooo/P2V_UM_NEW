Dear colleagues,

We have scheduled an additional Plan2Value Maintenance Window in order to install the latest release Planningspace 16.5 Update 6 in the production environment.
This update is scheduled for  Thursday, November 19th 2020, 19:00 (CET) until Friday, November 20th 2020 00:00 (CET).

The Plan2Value production environment will not be available during this time slot. We kindly ask you to save your work and logout before the start of the maintenance window.

Thanks
Plan2Value team
